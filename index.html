        <p>
        Something happened to me, recently. I am in a season of low, 
        and I am to remain low so that I am exalted in God's time. 
        Satan can quickly take advantage of my weakness by throwing many fiery darts. 
        I have to remember that I have been equipped with the shield of faith (cover and move)
